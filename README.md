# React Learning
 
I'm gonna save here everything i learn about react

## Intro

React is a framework, you can add directly to you html or install it

- shortcut to console in navigator option + command + i


- Babel order the code updated an put it in a way the navigator can understand it 


We need to specify where the page are gonna render the js code, we can create a div, put the js code inside the div,
with query selector and with the ReactDOM render it

## Lesson 1

Components : it's like lego parts that you can use to build your app, for example, the buttons can be components and be inside in a big component named form, each component is reponsable for one action, it could be an state or not (like a form : when you find a form in an app it could be empty, state 1, when you fill de form their state change, state 2), state: it how is the component info in an specific moment

Router : Can help us to navigate throw pages with out refresh the navigator

## Lesson 2

for creating a react app you can use vite or create react app (cra)
Vite is more lite because vite use the minimun resources for creating the react app, with cra you have an extra features installed.

the command to create a react app with vite is : yarn create vite or npm (npx) create vite
